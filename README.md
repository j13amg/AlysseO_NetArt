# Alysseo_NetArt

This was for project three of the Digital Media Design Class. My inspiration for this project was three of my favorite games I used to play when I was younger. The games you will see are Peggle, Putt-Putt, and Kid-pix. I used the colors you see in the games to tie everything together on this website.
